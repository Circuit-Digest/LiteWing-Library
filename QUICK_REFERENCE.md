# LiteWing Quick Reference

A simple lookup table of every function and property you'll use.

---

## 🔌 Connection

| Function | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `drone = LiteWing("192.168.43.42")` | Create a drone controller | Always — first line of every script |
| `drone.connect()` | Connect to the drone, start sensor data | Before reading sensors or flying |
| `drone.disconnect()` | Disconnect safely | End of every script |

**Example:**
```python
drone = LiteWing("192.168.43.42")
drone.connect()
print(drone.battery)
drone.disconnect()
```

## 🛫 Flight Commands

| Function | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `drone.arm()` | Prepare motors for flight | After `connect()`, before `takeoff()` |
| `drone.takeoff(height, duration)` | Take off and hover *(blocking)* | After `arm()` |
| `drone.hover(seconds)` | Hover in place for N seconds | Between maneuvers |
| `drone.land(duration)` | Descend and stop motors | When done flying |
| `drone.emergency_stop()` | **Kill all motors immediately** | Emergency only! Drone will fall |

**Typical flow:**
```python
drone.connect()
drone.arm()
drone.takeoff()       # drone lifts off
drone.hover(5)         # hover for 5 seconds
drone.land()          # come back down
drone.disconnect()
```

## 🕹️ Raw Control (No Sensors Needed)

| Function | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `drone.send_control(roll, pitch, yawrate, thrust)` | Send raw motor commands directly | Sensorless flight, testing motors |

- `roll` / `pitch`: tilt angles in degrees (−30 to +30)
- `yawrate`: spin rate in deg/s (−200 to +200)
- `thrust`: motor power (0–65535, ~20000 = hover)

> ⚠️ Start thrust low (~15000) and increase slowly. Use `emergency_stop()` if needed.

```python
drone.connect()
drone.send_control(thrust=15000)     # gentle lift
time.sleep(2)
drone.send_control(thrust=0)          # stop
drone.disconnect()
```

---

## 🏃 Movement Commands

All movement commands are **blocking** — they return when the drone arrives.

| Function | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `drone.pitch_forward(distance, speed)` | Pitch forward | push the drone forward by distance, speed in m/s |
| `drone.pitch_backward(distance, speed)` | Pitch backward | same as forward |
| `drone.roll_left(distance, speed)` | Roll left | same |
| `drone.roll_right(distance, speed)` | Roll right | same |

- `distance` defaults to `0.5m` (= `drone.maneuver_distance`)
- `speed` defaults to `0.2 m/s` (= max velocity setpoint)

**Example:**
```python
drone.pitch_forward(0.3)               # 30cm forward at 0.2 m/s
drone.pitch_forward(0.3, speed=0.7)    # same distance, faster
drone.roll_right(0.5)                  # 50cm to the right
```

## 🗺️ Waypoint Navigation

| Function | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `drone.fly_to(x, y, speed)` | Fly to absolute position *(blocking)* | Navigate to a specific coordinate |
| `drone.fly_path(waypoints, speed)` | Fly through a list of `(x, y)` points | Fly a shape or route |

**Coordinate system** (from drone's starting point):
- `+Y` = forward, `-Y` = backward
- `+X` = left, `-X` = right

**Example:**
```python
# Fly a triangle
drone.fly_to(0.0, 0.3)       # forward
drone.fly_to(-0.3, 0.0)      # right
drone.fly_to(0.0, 0.0)       # back to start

# Or use fly_path for a square
drone.fly_path([
    (0.0, 0.3),
    (-0.3, 0.3),
    (-0.3, 0.0),
    (0.0, 0.0),
], speed=0.3)
```

| `drone.circle(diameter, duration, face_direction)` | Fly a smooth circle | Smooth circular arcs |
| `drone.pentagon(length, duration, face_direction)` | Fly a regular pentagon | Geometric patterns |

- `face_direction=True` (default): drone nose faces direction of travel
- `face_direction=False`: drone keeps its initial heading
- All shapes reset position to origin before starting

**Example:**
```python
drone.square(length=0.6, duration=10)              # 60cm square in 10s
drone.circle(diameter=1.0, duration=8)              # 1m diameter circle in 8s
drone.triangle(length=0.5, duration=8, face_direction=False)  # fixed heading
```
